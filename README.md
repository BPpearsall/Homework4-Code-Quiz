As a coding bootcamp student I wanted to creat a Javascript quiz that is able to store and clear high scores.

When i am taking the code quiz, I am presenteed with a starting screen that allows me to access the highscores, or start the quiz.

Before I start the quiz i am able to read a small bit of text that states the general rules for the quiz and time deductions for incorrect answers

When I answer a question, another question will pop up regardless of whether my answer was correct or incorrect. 

If I answer a question incorrectly, there will be a deduction in the time remaining that will factor into my final score. 

If I answer correctly or incorrectly, an alert will appear notifying me of the status of my answer. 

When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game will end and I will be asked to enter in my initials that will be stored with whatever score I recieved

When I submit my score, it will send me to my highscores page which will list all of my recent highscores with an option to clear the local storage.
